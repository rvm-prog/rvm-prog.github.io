comment on NEJM paper Covid-19 tests

The paper discussed contains incomplete information on the problem of diagnosing Covid-19 infection. Emphasizing the problems of FN tests is only one side of the coin. 
The other side is the problems with FP results under different pretest probabilities. The tests described may be valuable in hospital environments to establish
a correct diagnosis of Covid-19 infection, however when the same tests are applied in the general population, the percentage of FN test results is not the thing
to worry about,but the number of FP test results may be too high to consider this test as an acceptable clinical tool.
